# FastFoodShop

#Introduction
The FastFoodShop project is a simple demonstration of the abstract factory design pattern in a fast food shop context. It provides two types of fast food shops: NonVegFastFood and VegFastFoodShop, each capable of creating different types of fast food products like burgers, momos, and sandwiches.
